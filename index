           <h2>What is League of Legends?</h2>
        <p>
            League of Legnds is a Multiplayer Online Battle Areana (MOBA) video game where each person controls a champion from a third person persepective. There are two different maps, Sumner's Rift amd Howling Abyss. The goal of each map is the same, to destroy the ememy nexus. Along the way each team needs to destroy enemy turrents and inhibitors before the nexus is exposed and can be destroyed. Each team is comprised of five team members. Each team member controls a champion which has some form of an auto attack along with skills that are unique to them and are used ingame by pressing q, w, e, and r.
